#Supervised Applied project
GDPR-Compliant WordPress Data Sovereignty Architecture

This repository contains the work-in-progress for the supervised applied project
developed within the CMDS 2025–2027 program. The project focuses on designing and
validating a WordPress architecture that supports GDPR compliance and data
sovereignty by providing explicit control and visibility over personal data
processing.

WordPress is widely used and highly extensible, but its plugin-driven ecosystem
often leads to opaque data flows and implicit reliance on third-party data
processors. This project addresses these challenges from an architectural
perspective, rather than through isolated configuration or legal measures.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze personal data processing in typical WordPress deployments
- Identify GDPR and data sovereignty risks introduced by plugins and external services
- Design a reference WordPress architecture aligned with GDPR principles
- Validate the proposed architecture using a practical WordPress test environment
